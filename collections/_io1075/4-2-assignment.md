# Task 1: Checking the Light Status

In this task you will learn how to establish a TCP connection and receive data from a light bulb. You will also build a basic server to explore the differences between client and server.

# Task 1.1: Reading the light bulb status (Socket client)
# Task 1.2: Listening for input (Socket server)
# Task 1.3: Ping
# Task 1.4: Debuging and managing exceptions

# Task 2: Listening to Switch Events

In this task you will learn a different model of communication, publish/subscribe, as opposed to a request/response model. This time, you will listen to events from the doorbell instead of checking its status.

# Task 2.1: Connect and subscribe

## Task 2.2: Decoding information
## Task 2.3: Triggering action by publishing

# Task 3: Integrating Network into the Lighting System

## Task 3.1: Make a class Switch which send data to the network
## Task 3.2: Make the LightBulb receive data to the network

# Task 4: Sequence and Component Diagram

As your program is now connecting several components through a network, it is the appropriate moment to learn how to draw a sequence and component diagram.

## Task 4.1: Component diagram
## Task 4.2: Sequence diagram
