description: "Bachelor Course - Industrial Design Engineering"
course-id: io1075
introduction: >-
  Welcome to Software-Based Product!
  
  In this course you will learn how to design and develop innovative connected products such as the [GoodNight Lamp](http://goodnightlamp.com/). You will learn about digital business models and value proposition in relation to the specification of a technical product architecture. This blended course involves individual programming assignments in Python as a mean to develop your computational thinking, as well as group experiments leading you through scientific techniques.
  
  This will prepare you for the roles of product manager, product designer and product developer to design and realize digital prototypes that are technically feasible and commercially viable.
explain: Explain core concepts related to the realisation of digital products, such as technical architecture, networks, databases, software development methods, business models, web technology and digital responsibility
specify: Specify algorithm and data structures driving the behaviour of a digital product through pseudo code and UML diagrams
make: Develop, test and debug software systems in Python 
collaborate: Work as teams in specifying and developing algorithms and software
analyse: Analyse and evaluate the technical aspects (code, data, network) and business aspects (canvas) of a connected product
evaluate: Apply techniques to experience and evaluate the feasibility and capabilities of digital technologies

## Activities

The course follows the blended learning approach.

The course uses a weekly cycle mixing theory and practice, thus a series of 8 formative modules followed by a week of revision and an exam in the 10th week.

Each week involves:
- the introduction of theoretical concepts (2hrs) through self-study video and reading materials, followed by a formative quiz;
- a live demo (2hrs) with a lecturer walking through some of the concepts in practice, and offering students a key moment for questions;
- a programming assignment (8hrs) to individually practice coding in the context of a connected home, with gradual complexity
- a lab experiment (8hrs) to experience in group key techniques and methods covered during the course.

# Deliverables

Every week, you will be invited to share your assignment and lab xp outcomes in the form of a blog post. This is an opportunity to get rich from others outcomes and collect feedback. A feedback podcast will provide tips and tops, closing up the module.

The assessment takes the form of an exam in week 10.
