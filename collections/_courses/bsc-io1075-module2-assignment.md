goal: In this assignment, we will scale up the lighting system to multiple light bulbs and rooms. This will involve data structures and strategies to keep your code healthy. It will involve packaging your code into a library and using dependencies (code from others). 
prog_environment: basics of command line
design: flow chart
code_management: code organisation (project structure, code style), VCS, test unit
computational_concepts: data structure (arrays, collections), scope

# Task 1: Test Units
In this task you will learn how to test your code by writing test units for each function of your code. It will ensure that your code works as expected and remains valid as you develop your code further.

## Task 1.1: Test the LightBulb code
## Task 1.2: Run a Test
## Task 1.3: Test the Button code


# Task 2: Dependencies
In this task you will learn how to use code from others, relying on external libraries.

## Task 2.1: Install/manage dependencies (dependencies)
## Task 2.2: Import the class Room (import)
## Task 2.3: Create a House class with an Array of Room (arrays)
## Task 2.4: Add LightBulbs and Switches to each room, inheriting a Thing

# Task 3: Scenarios
In this task you will learn how to 

## Task 3.1: Import a Scenario class
## Task 3.2: Explore how Scenarios have been defined
## Task 3.3: defining trigger and behaviour (if Switch1 is on, turn on all LightBulbs in Room X)


# Task 4. Version Control System
In this task you will learn how to keep track of changes in your code with Git, a version control system (VCS).

## Task 4.1 Git init
## Task 4.2 Git flow


# Task 5: Publish your Scenario
In this task you will learn how to make your code available to others through a Python library.

## Task 5.1 Structure your code as a library
## Task 5.2 Clean and document your code (style convention, README)
## Task 5.3 Publish your library
