# Introduction

This course combines technology and business topics to teach students how to design and develop innovative connected
products such as smart thermostat or pay-per-use washing machines. Students will learn about digital business
models and value proposition in relation to the specification of a technical product architecture. Students 
will be trained to combine the roles of product manager, product designer and product developer to design 
and realize a digital prototype that is technically feasible and commercially viable. Students will develop
a hands-on understanding of core digital technologies and software development methods, and will apply
techniques and practices for iteratively creating, validating and improving software-based products.
