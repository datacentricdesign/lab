# Introduction

This course combines technology and business topics to teach students how to design and develop innovative connected
products such as smart thermostat or pay-per-use washing machines. Students will learn about digital business
models and value proposition in relation to the specification of a technical product architecture. Students 
will be trained to combine the roles of product manager, product designer and product developer to design 
and realize a digital prototype that is technically feasible and commercially viable. Students will develop
a hands-on understanding of core digital technologies and software development methods, and will apply
techniques and practices for iteratively creating, validating and improving software-based products.

# Study Goals

After this course, you should be able to:

- explain core concepts related to the realisation of  digital products, such as technical architecture, networks, databases, software development methods, business models, web technology and digital responsibility
- specify algorithm and data structures driving the behaviour of a digital product through pseudo code and UML diagrams
- develop, test and debug software systems in Python 
- work as teams in specifying and developing algorithms and software
- analyse and evaluate the technical aspects (code, data, network) and business aspects (canvas) of a connected product


# Activities

The course follows the blended learning approach.

The course uses a weekly cycle mixing theory and practice, thus a series of 8 formative modules followed by a week of revision and an exam in the 10th week.

Each week involves:
- the introduction of theoretical concepts (2hrs) through self-study video and reading materials, followed by a formative quiz;
- a live demo (2hrs) with a lecturer walking through some of the concepts in practice, and offering students a key moment for questions;
- a programming assignment (8hrs) to individually practice coding in the context of a connected home, with gradual complexity
- a lab experiment (8hrs) to experience in group key techniques and methods covered during the course.
