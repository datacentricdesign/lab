introduction: In this second module, we will get an overview of the network terminology, topologies and qualities to consider during the design process. Then, we will explore different local network technologies such as Bluetooth and serial.

The tutorial 2 will lead you step-by-step to create a Bluetooth GATT service to transmit data from the wheel to the main frame of the wheelchair and trigger actuations.

During the lecture 3 we will look at web technologies connecting edge and cloud computing. We will explore the protocol HTTP and MQTT to highlight their differences and applications.

The tutorial 3 will lead you step-by-step to interact with other connected wheelchair via MQTT.

Assignment 2 focuses on mapping the technologies of your connected product and setting sensors and actuators on your prototype.

During the sandpit, you will present the technology map of your connected product and demo your working prototype.

After this iteration, you should be able:

(3) to explain the principles of Pull/Push and Pub/Sub communication mechanisms;

(4) to apply Pull/Push and Pub/Sub communication mechanisms with the HTTP, MQTT, Serial and Bluetooth protocols to exchange messages between devices and the cloud;

(6) to explain the role, benefits and limitations of cloud and edge computing for connected product service systems;
