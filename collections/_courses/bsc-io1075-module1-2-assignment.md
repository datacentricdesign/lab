introduction: In this assignment, you will get started with programming through the development of a traditional lighting system, including switches, dimmers and light bulbs. 
prog_environment: environment (IDE, Jupyter), code execution
design: state diagrams, class diagrams
code_management: comments, functions
computational_concepts: variables, types, boolean expression, objects, control flow

# Task 1: Environment
In this task you will get familiar with a cloud Integrated Development Editor (IDE).

## Task 1.1: Connect to the cloud programming environment
## Task 1.2: Get familiar with the interface


# Task 2: Execution
In this task you will execute your first Python program to display a welcome message in the terminal.

## Task 2.1: Print ‘Welcome home!’ (print out)
## Task 2.2: Basic syntax (comments, strings)
## Task 2.3: Print ‘Welcome home, <name>!’ (string variables)

# Task 3: States and conditions

In this task you will learn more variable types and operations to compare them.

## Task 3.1: Create a button and light states (boolean)
## Task 3.2: Change light state based on button state (boolean operation)
## Task 3.3: Add a second button and light bulb (more states and conditions)


# Task 4: Code Organisation

In this task you will learn how to use functions and classes to structure your code.

## Task 4.1: Organise the logic into a function (functions)
## Task 4.2: Organise the states into objects Button and LightBulb (object, classes)


# Task 5: Control flow and loops

In this task you will learn about control flows and loops to define more complex behaviours.

## Task 5.1: Toggles (operators, if statements)
## Task 5.2: Create a DimmableLightBulb and ColorLightBulb (floats, integers)
## Task 5.3: Create a Long-press button (functions/methods)
## Task 5.4: Light bulb patterns: blinking, fading (control loops)


# Task 6: Specification

In this final task you will learn how to specify the structures and behaviours you have implemented through class and state diagrams

## Task 6.1: Draw a class diagram
## Task 6.2: Draw a state diagram
