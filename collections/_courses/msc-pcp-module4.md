introduction: In this 4th module we will introduce data processing, from streaming analysis to the Machine Learning Pipeline.

The tutorial 6 will lead you step-by-step to use your labelled data and train a machine learning algorithm. You will use the algorithm output to control actuators.

During the lecture 7 we will wrap up the course, focusing on testing with a prototype and reflecting on insights.

The tutorial 7 will lead you step-by-step to use your prototype to test your design and reflect on it.

Assignment 4 focuses on integrating a data processing component in your prototype and prepare for the exhibition.

After this iteration, you should be able to

(8) set up actuators and control them with a data-driven algorithm;

(10) explain the role of the main components of a machine learning pipeline;

(11) document your prototyping process and collaborate with your peers, using Git and GitHub;

(12) adapt and integrate pieces of code, using languages Python and C in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using Arduino IDE and Atom;

(13) express design considerations using appropriate literacy for effective discussion with ICT engineers.
