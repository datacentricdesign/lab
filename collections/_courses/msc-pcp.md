The purpose of this course is to get knowledge and skills on the development and use of prototypes for connected products.

During the course, you will develop four iterations of a connected product per group, along the following design brief:

‘While the population of wheelchair users is growing worldwide, it becomes urgent to design supportive technologies that fit their needs. We aim to develop products for improvement of the wheelchair users’ well-being. This design is a connected product that collects data from sensors, processes it in order to actuate user interactions embedded on the wheelchair.’
