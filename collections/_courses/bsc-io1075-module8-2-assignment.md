introduction: In this assignment, you will develop a home security system that opens the door when a person is recognised. When the infrared sensor detects movement, you will subscribe to the video stream and start recording for a minute. When the outdoor button is pressed, you will subscribe to the audio stream, for 3 seconds, send the record to a text-to-speech API and compare the text to a defined password in order to open the door.
