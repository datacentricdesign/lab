introduction: In this assignment you will shape the behaviour of your lamp with code. You will first use pseudo code to specify the behaviour, then apply the concepts of Object-Oriented programming to structure your implementation.
prog_environment:
design: class diagrams
code_management: code organisation (project structure, code style)
computational_concepts: classes, objects, methods control flow

# Task 1: Pseudo Code


# Task 2: Object-Oriented

## Task 4.2: Organise the states into objects Button and LightBulb (object, classes)


# Task 3: Control flow and loops

In this task you will learn about control flows and loops to define more complex behaviours.

## Task 3.1: Toggles (operators, if statements)
## Task 3.2: Create a DimmableLightBulb and ColorLightBulb (floats, integers)
## Task 3.3: Create a Long-press button (functions/methods)

## Task 4: Light bulb patterns such as blinking, fading (control loops), breathing, pulsing, color


## Task 5: Draw a class diagram
