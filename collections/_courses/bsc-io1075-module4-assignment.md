**Goal**:  In this assignment, you will get started with programming through the development of a traditional lighting system, including switches, dimmers and light bulbs. 
      
* Programming environment: environment (IDE, Jupyter), code execution
* Design: state diagrams, class diagrams
* Code management: - comments, functions
* Computational concepts: variables, types, boolean expression, objects, control flow

# Task 1:

## Step 1.1:


Assignment 4: Data Management (Week topic: Data)
Goal: In this assignment, you will focus on the data. Developing a smart thermostat, you will regularly fetch data from a temperature sensor, parse the data, and decide to turn on/off the heating system based on a set temperature. You will keep logs in a file and store the temperature data in a database.

Programming environment: -
Design: data model (E-R Model)
Code management: logs
Computational concepts:  files, database, data format (CSV)

Task 1: Explore Thermostat API

Task 2: Calculate a Moving Average

Task 3: Control the Heating System

Task 4: Log Actions into a File

Task 5: Store thermostat data into a database
