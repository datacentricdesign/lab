introduction: In this first module, we will clarify the purpose of a prototype in the context of connected products. Then, we will rely on a demo to extract the components that compose an 'IoT stack'. Finally, we will go through the course objective and practicalities.

The tutorial 1 will lead you step-by-step to build the initial setup of your prototype. You will use Git and GitHub to manage and share your code within your team.

Assignment 1 focuses on exploring the capabilities of sensors and actuators, make a selection of the relevance for your design.

During the sandpit, you will pitch your design and motivate the choice of sensors and actuators.

After this iteration, you should be able

(1) to explain the role and interaction between hardware prototyping platforms of type microcontrollers, microprocessors and servers;

(2) to set up an Arduino (microcontroller) and a Raspberry Pi (microprocessor) as a foundation of a connected product prototype;

(5) to select a list of sensors and actuators and motivate the relevance for their design;
