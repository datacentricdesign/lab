description: Prototyping Connected Product
introduction: >-
    In this course, you will develop your ability to build and use functional prototypes as part of your design process. You will gain this prototyping experience through the guided development of a connected light product. In teams of three, you will build and use several iterations of this product with a strong focus on the technology and the functional implementation. You will rely on a Raspberry Pi -- small computer -- to sense contextual changes and control connected light bulbs via Python code. Your prototype will help you gain an understanding of the technologies through tests and data exploration.
