introduction: Helping designers to use multiple data streams in the design of intelligent behaviours
---

Data is an emerging design material, providing designers with a vast array of input to combine when designing intelligent products and services. However, the lack of data literacy and the complexity of setting up mean- ingful data exploration prevent de- signers to leverage this new resource.

**How can designers orchestrate observational, subjective and sensor data to effectively and appropriately inform their design?**

In this project you will design and evaluate a Human-Data Interaction (HDI) for designers. Your prototype will be the vehicle to better under- stand what designers need to make use of multiple stream of data while designing intelligent products and services. This project will take place in the context of supportive relaxation.

# Project Aim

The aim of this graduation project is to inform the development of data-centric tools for the design of intelligent behaviours.

This project touches upon a range of subjects:
* Data literacy
* Object with Intent (OwI)
* Designing with data

# Interested?

Depending on your background and interest, this project can involve a deep dive in data exploration, prototyping of connected services or the elaboration of new value propo- sitions.
