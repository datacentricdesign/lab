introduction: Designers collect sensor data on a wheelchair to recognise key moments such as eating, working or washing. They video record the data collection to keep track of the performed activities. To train machine learning algorithms with this data and recognise activities, designers need to tell the algorithm what data represents which activities (training process). The labeler shows a stream of data (e.g. time series, pictures, video) and let designers selects the appropriate label for each time frame.
