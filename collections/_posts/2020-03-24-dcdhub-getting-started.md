# Step 1: Tools

Here you can find the recommended tools to get started:

- [The code editors](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/2019/04/30/tool-ide)
- [Git & GitHub](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/2019/09/10/tools-git)
    
# Step 2: Data-Centric Design Hub

The next step is to get familiar with the DCD Hub, relying on three main concepts:

* A **Person** represents a physical person, signed up on the hub. It can own, share and
 have access to Things. A person has:
 
  * a email address (its unique identifier),
  * a name
  * a password (at least 8 characters)

* A **Thing** represents a physical or virtual component collecting data. For example, a
phone which collects acceleration, a website recording number of page views. A Thing
has:

  * an unique identifier (or id), automatically generated by the hub 
  * a name
  * a type (optional), to give a type to the Thing (e.g. Phone, Wheelchair, Website)
  * a description (optional)
  * a list of properties (optional) which values change over time

* A **Property** represents a Thing property

  * an unique identifier (or id), automatically generated by the hub 
  * a name
  * a type, which characterise the nature of the property and its number of
  dimensions ([See Property Types](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/2020/03/24/dcdhub/api.html#property-types))
  * a list of dimensions
  * a 2-dimension list of values, starting with a [UNIX TIMESTAMP](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)
  and followed by the value of each dimension. All values MUST be numbers.

```json
[
  ["UNIX timestamp", "value-dimension-1", "value-dimension-2"],
  ["UNIX timestamp", "value-dimension-1", "value-dimension-2"]
]
```
  
  * a list of classes (optional): if the property type is 'CLASS', you can associate
  text to the values. This is useful when using a property as data label.

# Sign Up

To register, go to <a href="https://dwd.tudelft.nl/subject" target="_blank">https://dwd.tudelft.nl/subject</a>

![DCD Hub](/assets/img/posts/dcdhub.png)

Sign up with an email address, a name and a password.

![Sign up](/assets/img/posts/signup.png)

The sign up process creates an account, then the standard OAuth2 process starts
with a consent: you need to let the web application access your newly created account,
so that it can help you it! To do so click "Allow access".

![Consent](/lab/assets/img/posts/consent.png)

Once the consent succeeded, you can click on '+' button and create a first one.

![Create Thing - Button](/lab/assets/img/posts/create_thing_button.png)

For example with the name 'My Connected Prototype', type 'Prototype', and a
description.

![Create Thing - Dialog](/lab/assets/img/posts/create_thing_dialog.png)

**The process may take a few seconds**, as the hub generates an access token for your Thing.

![Create Thing - JWT](/lab/assets/img/posts/create_thing_jwt.png)

**COPY AND SAVE THIS TOKEN** in a text file, it will be shown only once and enables
your wheelchair to communicate with the hub. You can also save the thing id, but
you can always go back to the manager to retrieve this id.

# Step 3: SDK

From here you can continue with the SDK (Software Development Kit) of your choice:

- [Python](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/lab/2020/03/24/dcdhub-sdk-python.html)
- [Javascript](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/lab/2020/03/24/dcdhub-sdk-js.html)
