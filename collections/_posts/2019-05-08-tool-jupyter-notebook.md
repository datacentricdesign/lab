Note: if you use Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook is likely to be installed already.

You can install Jupyter Notebook with the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Then, you can start with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Running this command should redirect you to your favorite web browser and open
the Jupyter web interface. Otherwise, a link shows up in the terminal, you can
copy/paste it in your web browser.

Downloads this Jupyter example to start exploring the your data (right-click and 'Save link As...'):
