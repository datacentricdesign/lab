introduction: What do we mean by Data-Centric Design? Data-Centric Design is an approach to engage with data throughout the design process. In this context, data comes from machine's inputs (e.g. the IoT), designer's observations (e.g. notes during a user experiment) or people's voice (e.g. reviews or tweets on the web). All these forms of data are strongly connected to time, a key element to intertwine them in the design process. We distinguish data as a tool to design (e.g. helping us understand a design context or evaluate design solutions) from data as a design material (e.g. powering an AI driven product).

In this post we go through several design projects to illustrate Data-Centric Design.
