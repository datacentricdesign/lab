The purpose of this course is to get knowledge and skills on the development
and use of prototypes for connected products.

During the course, you will develop four iterations of a connected product per
group, along the following design brief:

*‘While the population of wheelchair users is growing worldwide, it becomes urgent
to design supportive technologies that fit their needs. We aim to develop products
for the improvement of the wheelchair users’ well-being. This design is a connected
product that collects data from sensors, processes it in order to actuate user
interactions embedded on the wheelchair.’*
