introduction: Designers video record people in the street in order to capture their interaction with delivery robots. They want to understand human responses to a set of robot reaction to design behaviours that balance delivery efficiency and social acceptability. While gathering this data is key to capture the rich context, this approach through video invades people's privacy. The Ethical Filter ensures that designers access only what they need by playing on the range, resolution, rate of data streams.
