  Welcome to Prototyping Connected Products!

  In this course you will experience prototyping of a connected lighting system. In groups, you will go through three prototyping iterations with a strong focus on the technology and the functional implementation. You will rely on Raspberry Pi and Arduino-like devices to control connected light bulbs via Python code. Your prototype will help you gain an understanding of the technologies through tests and data exploration.
explain: Explain the technology stack of Internet of Things, the main components of a machine learning pipeline and the role of prototyping in this context
specify: Express design considerations using appropriate literacy for effective discussion with ICT engineers.
make: Develop a prototype of connected product by adapting and integrating pieces of code, using languages Python.
collaborate: Document the prototyping process and collaborate with peers, using Git and GitHub;
analyse: Conduct and report data collection campaign to generate a labelled dataset with the implemented sensors;
evaluate: Motivate the selection of technological components;

## Activities

The course follows the blended learning approach.

The course involves three module of two weeks, followed by a week of revision and an exam in the 10th week.

Each week involves:
- the introduction of theoretical concepts (2hrs) through self-study video and reading materials, followed by a formative quiz;
- a live demo (2hrs) with a lecturer walking through some of the concepts in practice, and offering students a key moment for questions;
- an programming assignment (4-8hrs) to develop in group the prototype of a home lighting system, with gradual complexity
- a lab experiment (4-8hrs) to test in group, making use of the prototype developed so far.
