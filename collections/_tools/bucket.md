Designers prototype their design to evaluate the feasibility, desirability and viability of their concepts through performance measurements or user testing. These can be captured by machine data. Designers often lack the programming skills to effectively implement data collection as part of their prototypes. Bucket is a data cloud platform with a set of API and SDK to facilitate ingestion and distribution of data from various languages and platforms.
