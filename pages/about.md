Jacky is tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. With a background in computer science, he explores the exciting interface between Design and the Internet of Things with a focus on personal data.

He develops tools and methods for Responsible Data-Centric Design (RDCD), that is accounting for data subject privacy, data collection and processing transparency, involvement of stakeholders, data confidence and design process traceability.
