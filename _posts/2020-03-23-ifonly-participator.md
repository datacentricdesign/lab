introduction: Designers collect energy data from households to understand how householders consume electricity in order to design supportive solutions. While such data gives a clear picture of what happens (i.e. when energy is consumed and for what), it is hard to understand why? It is challenging to engage end-users in data analysis as they lack the data literacy and the benefits to do so. The participator helps designers to build interactive data visualisation (potential) end-users can engage with to correct and enrich.
