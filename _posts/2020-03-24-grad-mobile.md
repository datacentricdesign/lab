introduction: Designing ways to engage people into informed and purposeful data donation
---

Designers increasingly use data from sensors to better understand their (potential) end-users. However, this data often reveal intimate behaviour about their data subjects, leading to regulations as well as solution for data control and privacy.
Ubiquitous and versatile, mobile phones appear as a key enabler for mechanisms that inform and engage people in donating their data for purposes they care about.


**What is the role of mobile phone in the data donation experience?**

In this project you will design and evaluate mobile phone user experi- ences to inform and engage people in donating data for the design of products, services and systems (PSS).

# Project Aim

The aim of this graduation project is to inform strategies for data-centric design supporting ethical use of data as well as fostering valuable knowl- edge for designers.

This project touches upon a range of subjects:

* Mobile user experience
* Informed consent
* Designing with Data

# Interested?

Depending on your background and interest, this project can involve a deep dive in user experience design or the development and deployment of an application prototype.
