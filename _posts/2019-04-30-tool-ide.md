# Atom

The first tool we need is a code editor, commonly called IDE (integrated
development editor). For this we will use Atom, as it is open source and popular
for its modularity.

Download and start Atom <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Atom has the typical features of an IDE, we will go through them during this workshop.
The first of them is the terminal. A terminal is a text-based interface we use
to enter and execute commands on a computer. While we will maximize the use of
graphical tools, we will also use the terminal in some occasions.

On the top menu, go to Packages > Settings View > Install Packages/Themes

Search for 'terminal plus' and install the first one 'platformio-ide-terminal'

Now you can open a terminal by clicking on the + sign in the bottom left corner.



# Arduino IDE

Similar to Atom, the Arduino IDE is an editor with a convenient set of tools to program
Arduino-like devices. You can download and install the latest version from
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">here</a>.
