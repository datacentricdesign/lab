introduction: Designers benefit from data integration. The greater variety of data, the better to draw rich views on (potential) users and their behaviours. Although designer intentions might be good, data subjects are often left unaware of data collection and use, without ability to choose or unable to appreciate values and risks. Data Box is a dashboard for data subjects to keep track of what data is collected about them, what is done with their data and what can be done with their data. It allows them to keep control over their data.
